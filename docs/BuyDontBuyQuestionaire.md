🧠 Scientifically Accurate 5-Question Framework

(Each question maps to a validated psychological mechanism.)

#	Question	Scientific Basis	If "YES" →	If "NO" →
1	“Did I plan to buy this before today?”	Precommitment & Planning Effect — unplanned buys are the definition of impulse buying.	Proceed to next question (could still be a thoughtful buy).	→ WAIT / Don’t buy — impulse alert.
2	“Will this purchase clearly improve my life or solve a real problem?”	Goal-congruence theory — when a purchase aligns with personal goals or problem-solving, satisfaction and utility are higher.	Proceed; likely meaningful.	→ WAIT — reassess motivation.
3	“Would I still want this if I had to wait 48 hours?”	Delay discounting & temporal distancing — impulsivity decreases when forced to delay reward.	Proceed — desire is stable.	→ WAIT — re-evaluate later.
4	“Can I easily afford it without affecting my budget or priorities?”	Cognitive load & self-control theory — financial strain triggers regret and stress.	Proceed — financially viable.	→ DON’T BUY — risk to stability.
5	“Am I emotionally neutral right now (not stressed, sad, or bored)?”	Affective forecasting & emotional regulation research — strong emotions distort perceived value and lead to post-purchase regret.	Proceed — rational state.	→ WAIT — emotion-driven urge.
