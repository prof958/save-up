## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Scope
Starting with a focused MVP:
- Three screens (Home, Spending, Profile)
- Simple calculator
- Basic authentication
- No history tracking (for now)

This keeps the project achievable and testable quickly, with clear paths for enhancement later.

### Technical Choices
- **TypeScript in strict mode**: Better type safety, fewer runtime errors
- **Expo over bare React Native**: Faster setup, easier Google OAuth
- **Supabase over custom backend**: All-in-one auth and database solution
- **Client-side calculations**: No backend needed for math, works offline
- **Tab navigation**: Simple, mobile-standard pattern
- **Functional components with React.FC**: Consistent typing pattern

## Metrics for Success (Once Built)
- Authentication works reliably on both platforms
- Calculator responds instantly (<100ms)
- App launches in under 3 seconds
- No crashes during basic flows
- UI is clear and intuitive
- Works on iOS 13+ and Android 5.0+

## Next Session Priorities
1. **Build Profile Screen**: Display and edit user salary, currency, region - show questionnaire results
2. **Connect Buy/Don't Buy buttons**: Save decisions to AsyncStorage (without "Let Me Think")
3. **Update Home Screen with real data**: Pull decisions from AsyncStorage to populate stats and reminders
4. **Add animations**: Modal transitions and button interactions
5. **Test end-to-end flow**: Complete user journey from calculator to home screen updates
6. **Polish & refinements**: Error handling, edge cases, haptic feedback

## Development Time Estimate
**Total MVP Time**: ~25-30 hours
**Time Spent So Far**: ~19 hours (Phases 1-5 complete except Profile Screen)
**Remaining**: ~6-11 hours

**Progress Breakdown**:
- Phase 1 (Foundation): 2 hours ‚úÖ
- Phase 2 (Authentication): 3 hours ‚úÖ
- Phase 3 (Onboarding): 6 hours ‚úÖ
- Phase 4 (Home Screen): 4 hours ‚úÖ
- Phase 5 (Spending Calculator): 4 hours ‚úÖ
- Phase 6 (Profile Screen & Integration): 3-4 hours (estimated)
- Phase 7 (Polish & Polish): 2-3 hours (estimated)
- Phase 8 (Google OAuth): 2-3 hours (optional)
- Phase 9 (Testing & Deployment): 4-6 hours (estimated)
