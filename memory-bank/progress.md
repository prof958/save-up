## Known Issues
- None yet (no code written)

## Deferred Features (Future Versions)
- Purchase decision history tracking
- Statistics dashboard (money saved, purchases avoided)
- Savings goals
- Customizable investment return rate
- Multiple income source support
- Notifications for "Let Me Think" items
- Dark mode
- Onboarding tutorial
- Data export

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Scope
Starting with a focused MVP:
- Three screens (Home, Spending, Profile)
- Simple calculator
- Basic authentication
- No history tracking (for now)

This keeps the project achievable and testable quickly, with clear paths for enhancement later.

### Technical Choices
- **TypeScript in strict mode**: Better type safety, fewer runtime errors
- **Expo over bare React Native**: Faster setup, easier Google OAuth
- **Supabase over custom backend**: All-in-one auth and database solution
- **Client-side calculations**: No backend needed for math, works offline
- **Tab navigation**: Simple, mobile-standard pattern
- **Functional components with React.FC**: Consistent typing pattern

## Metrics for Success (Once Built)
- Authentication works reliably on both platforms
- Calculator responds instantly (<100ms)
- App launches in under 3 seconds
- No crashes during basic flows
- UI is clear and intuitive
- Works on iOS 13+ and Android 5.0+

## Next Session Priorities
1. **Build Profile Screen UI**: Salary input form with monthly/annual toggle
2. **Create ProfileContext**: Manage profile state with TypeScript
3. **Implement profile CRUD**: Connect to Supabase user_profiles table
4. **Build Spending Calculator**: Price input and calculation modal
5. **Display results**: Work hours and investment value calculations
6. **Add decision buttons**: Buy, Don't Buy, Let Me Think actions

## Development Time Estimate
**Total MVP Time**: ~20-25 hours
**Time Spent So Far**: ~5 hours (Phase 1 + Phase 2)
**Remaining**: ~15-20 hours

**Progress Breakdown**:
- Phase 1 (Foundation): 2 hours ✅
- Phase 2 (Authentication): 3 hours ✅
- Phase 3 (Profile & Calculator): 6-8 hours (estimated)
- Phase 4 (Polish & Google OAuth): 4-6 hours (estimated)
