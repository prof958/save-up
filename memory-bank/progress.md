## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Scope
Starting with a focused MVP:
- Three screens (Home, Spending, Profile)
- Simple calculator
- Basic authentication
- No history tracking (for now)

This keeps the project achievable and testable quickly, with clear paths for enhancement later.

### Technical Choices
- **TypeScript in strict mode**: Better type safety, fewer runtime errors
- **Expo over bare React Native**: Faster setup, easier Google OAuth
- **Supabase over custom backend**: All-in-one auth and database solution
- **Client-side calculations**: No backend needed for math, works offline
- **Tab navigation**: Simple, mobile-standard pattern
- **Functional components with React.FC**: Consistent typing pattern

## Metrics for Success (Once Built)
- Authentication works reliably on both platforms
- Calculator responds instantly (<100ms)
- App launches in under 3 seconds
- No crashes during basic flows
- UI is clear and intuitive
- Works on iOS 13+ and Android 5.0+

## Next Session Priorities
1. **Multi-Account Testing**: Verify user-scoped storage prevents data leakage between accounts
2. **Stats Consistency Testing**: Confirm HomeScreen and ProfileScreen show identical numbers
3. **Personality Test Retake**: Test full navigation flow from Profile ‚Üí Questionnaire ‚Üí back
4. **Input Validation**: Verify 15-char limits work correctly across all screens
5. **Keyboard Behavior**: Test on both iOS and Android to confirm no button clipping
6. **Modal Dismissal**: Verify tap-outside works on all 4 modals
7. **Production Build**: Create EAS build for real device testing (if needed)

## Development Time Tracking
**Total MVP Time**: ~30-35 hours (original estimate: 25-30 hours)
**Time Spent So Far**: ~29 hours (Phases 1-7 complete)
**Remaining**: ~5-8 hours (testing, optional features, deployment)

**Progress Breakdown**:
- Phase 1 (Foundation): 2 hours ‚úÖ
- Phase 2 (Authentication): 3 hours ‚úÖ
- Phase 3 (Onboarding): 6 hours ‚úÖ
- Phase 4 (Home Screen): 4 hours ‚úÖ
- Phase 5 (Spending Calculator): 4 hours ‚úÖ
- Phase 6 (Currency & Profile Screen): 5 hours ‚úÖ
- Phase 7 (Bug Fixes & UI Refinements): 5 hours ‚úÖ
- Phase 8 (Production Testing): 3-4 hours (estimated)
- Phase 9 (Google OAuth): 2-3 hours (optional, deferred)
- Phase 10 (App Store Deployment): 4-6 hours (estimated)

**Note**: Phase 7 took longer than expected due to discovering and fixing critical architecture issues (cross-account data leakage, stats inconsistency, generated column errors). These fixes significantly improved app security and reliability.
